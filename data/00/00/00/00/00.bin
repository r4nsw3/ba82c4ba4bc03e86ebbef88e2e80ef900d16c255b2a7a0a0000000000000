  |   On the morning of your sixteenth birthday, you are charged with a     |
  |   seemingly impossible task by the King himself: to assume the mantle   |
  |   of your father Ortega, hero of the land of Aliahan, and slay the      |
  |   Archfiend Baramos, master of darkness! What trials await you,         |
  |   intrepid hero, as you set out on a quest not even your legendary      |
  |   father was strong enough to complete?                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Set out on an adventure with a party of up to four characters who     |
  |   can be customised to your specifications at Patty's Party Planning    |
  |   Place: choose names, genders and jobs.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Assign your party member any of up to 9 vocations, a choice which     |
  |   will dictate their stats, equipment, spells and abilities.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Though the hero's role has been decided by fate, the jobs of all      |
  |   the other characters are yours to change as you see fit.              |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Observe how the personality system changes how your character         |
  |   grows, making your party always unique.                               |
  |                                                                         |
